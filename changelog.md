## LMS Controls - Change Log

**January 27, 2019**

Updated script **config/shell/spot_playlist.sh** to randomly pick 1 of the top 10 playlists returned from the query.  This way you get a bit more variety when asking for a particular Spotify playlist rather than always getting the top playlist returned.  

**January 24, 2019**

Updated package file lmscontrols.yaml changing **platform: time** to **platform: time_pattern** due to breaking change in Home Assistant 0.86+

**January 21, 2019**

Minor update to the shell files and the package file was required, basic details are as follows:
- **Shell files:**
  - Fixed dangling quote / double quote in all shell files except env_var.sh. - **CRITICAL** this prevented proper posting of shell query results on some systems
  - Fixed hard coded URL in qry_player_stat.sh - **CRITICAL**

- **Package file:**
  - Fixed some duplicate alias', NON-CRITICAL

**January 18, 2019**

- Updated Home Assistant Installation as follows:
  - Use package file for the bulk of the lms_controls app which includes sections for configuration, automation, intent, scripts, groups and customize
  - New features / upgrades include:
      - Added field in HA GUI to show returned query result (input_text.lms_qry_result)
      - Use of contractions in queries no longer returns invalid query results
      - "env.sh" file where you enter your security details only once, all shell files refer to this file for security details (ie: HA_Token, client ID, IP addresses, usernames, password, etc.
      - Audio feedback available on the results of your queries, follow up, what's playing and player status
      - HA GUI current player settings are refreshed automatically from LMS server every 60 seconds to keep everything in sync if users are using LMS interface instead of HA GUI
      - More error checking on the returned query results from the shell script files.  When query result is null, lms will not be affected (won't clear the queue)
      - Used shell files for all query functions for consistency and to allow better error checking.
      - Update shell files to handle both unsecured and secure LMS installations.  **Note:** secured install requires the use of socat in shell files.  
  - Updated DialogFlow to include some new intents (what's playing, player status and follow up for all query functions)
  - Updated installation, troubleshooting and example commands documents 
  - Created HASSIO installation details for multiple platforms to help users new to HASSIO
  - Updated audio demo of LMS Controls for new features

  - Added `intent.yaml` which contains the Intent Actions from DialogFlow and performs the proper actions, launches other scripts and provides feedback to Google
