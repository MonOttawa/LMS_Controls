## Hass.io or Home Assistant Installation

## Multiple Platforms - PI, PI-OSMC, Debian

------

The following document outlines the steps required to install and configure HassIO or Home Assistant on multiple platforms including stand-alone Raspberry PI, PI with OSMC and Intel / AMD with Debian.

The preferred software distribution is Hass.io as it is a combination of Home Assistant and assorted tools which allows you to run it easily on a Raspberry Pi and other platforms.  In addition Hass.io also allows the installation of a large assortment of add-ons (Configurator, DuckDNS, Let's Encrypt) in a easy to configure method for Home Assistant.

The current list of Hass.io or Home Assistant installation platforms covered by this document are:

- Hass.io stand alone with Raspberry PI series
- Hass.io on Raspberry PI running OSMC (kodi) image.
- Hass.io on generic Debian server or even Desktop I suppose 

Any users who are willing to take the time to detail their installation process for Hass.io or Home Assistant on their platform are welcome to submit their instructions and I will include them here.  This software can be installed on most systems with a bit of tweaking.

Before we go too far, here is a list of resources that can help with the installation on other platforms which may not have been detailed here.
